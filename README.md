Mistake when displaying fonts Ventura 13.1
Error showing fonts Ventura 13.1 I have a problem when updating my macbook with opencore latest version 0.5.3, the fonts are no longer visible, they disappear completely. Another of the "details" that I would like to change is when starting the macbook, delete the icon when starting the macbook, "boot picker". I don't want it to be visible at startup and start directly with the apple logo.
