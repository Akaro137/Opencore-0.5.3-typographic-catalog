# Opencore-0.5.3-typographic-catalog
Mistake when displaying fonts Ventura 13.1
I have a problem when updating my macbook with opencore latest version 0.5.3, the fonts are no longer visible, they completely disappear. Another of the "details" that I would like to change is when starting the macbook, that the boot icon, boot picker, does not appear.
